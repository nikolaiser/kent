**kent** - use kubernetes secrets in nix shells

## Overview

Managing multiple Kubernetes environments (like staging or development) often involves juggling various configuration settings, such as database connection strings or Kafka credentials. Keeping these secrets organized and up-to-date across different environments can be tedious.

**kent** simplifies this process by pulling secret values directly from a Kubernetes namespace and passing them into your Nix flake's input. This allows you to leverage Nix's features seamlessly, such as setting up development shells that export environment variables or create scripts for data access. Switching environments is easy - just exit the current devshell and rerun the `kent` command with the desired namespace.

## Usage

1. Add the `kent` package to your nix configuration or use a shell to try it out

```bash
nix shell github:nikolaiser/kent
```

2. Modify the flake that you want to use kubernetes secrets in. `kent` uses the following mechanism for passing the secrets. First it creates a temporary file and writes the secrets to it as a json. To avoid leaking the secrets into nix store, another temporary file is created and the first file's path is written into it. This file is then passed to the flake using `--override-input`

By default `kent` will pass this file to the input called `kent`, however it can be overridden (see Reference)

```nix
{
  inputs = {
    ...
    kent = {
      url = "file+file:///dev/null";
      flake = false;
    };
    ...
  };

  outputs = {kent, ...}: 
    let
    ...
      secretsPath = lib.readFile kent.outPath;

      # `secretsPath` points to the file with extracted secrets in form of json object. For example
      # `{"secretName"={"data"={"name1" == "..."},"stringData"={...}},"anotherSecret"= {...}}`
    ...
    in 
    {
    ...
    };
}
```

3. Run `kent`

```bash
kent -f <your-flake>
```

## Reference

```bash

‚ùØ kent --help
Usage: kent [OPTIONS] --flake <FLAKE>

Options:
  -f, --flake <FLAKE>          Nix flake to use
  -i, --input <INPUT>          Flake input that will be used to provide the secret values [default: kent]
  -s, --selector <SELECTOR>    Filter which secret are propagated. For example '-s metadata.name=foo -s metadata.name=bar,metadata.labels.bazz=true'. Multiple expressions are combined as following '-s a -s b,c' <==> 'a || (b && c)' [default: ]
  -n, --namespace <NAMESPACE>  Namespace to extract secret values from. If not provided the currently active one will be used
  -c, --command <COMMAND>      Nix command to run [default: develop]
  -m, --mode <MODE>            Mode for the temporary file containing secrets json [default: 0400]
  -h, --help                   Print help
  -V, --version                Print version

```
